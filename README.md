# SQL

## General Notes:

SQL Operators
AND
OR
IN/NOT IN 
LIKE/NOT LIKE
BETWEEN AND
EXISTS/NOT EXIST
IS NULL/IS NOT NULL
Comparison operators


SQL will prioritize AND > OR regardless of the order in which you use the operators.

WHERE column_name IN (); IN allows you to input a list into the parentheses and is runs faster than OR operator
